## Overview

The system solves three core challenges in coupon processing at scale:

1. **Race conditions** — Two users applying the same limited coupon simultaneously will never both succeed. Reservations are committed through a Lua script that runs atomically inside Redis.
2. **Dynamic rules** — Coupon rules (limits, eligibility, discounts) are versioned in MySQL. Jobs always load the latest active settings at execution time, so rule changes take effect immediately without redeployment or cache flushes.
3. **Reliability** — Every job is idempotent and retryable. A failed job leaves no orphaned state. Stuck reservations are cleaned up automatically by a scheduled recovery job.

## Architecture

```
Client
  │
  ▼
POST /api/coupons/apply
  │
  ▼
CouponController          ← dispatches job, returns 202 immediately
  │
  ▼
ValidateCouponJob          [queue: high]
  ├─ CouponRuleEngine      ← loads latest CouponSetting from MySQL
  ├─ CouponReservationService  ← Lua script atomically reserves in Redis
  └─ TrackCouponEventJob   [queue: low]  ← writes coupon_events row

Client polls GET /api/coupons/status/{requestId}
  │
  ▼
Redis status key           ← set by job, TTL 10 min

On checkout success:
  POST /api/coupons/consume → ConsumeCouponJob  [queue: default]
    ├─ writes coupon_usages (MySQL, inside transaction)
    └─ releases Redis reservation

On checkout failure:
  POST /api/coupons/release → ReleaseCouponJob  [queue: default]
    └─ deletes Redis reservation key + sorted set entry
```

## User Journey

```
1. User applies coupon at checkout
         │
         ▼
2. API returns immediately: "Coupon verification in progress"
         │
         ▼
3. ValidateCouponJob runs asynchronously
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │         │
  Valid    Invalid
    │         │
    ▼         ▼
4. Coupon   User sees
   reserved  failure reason
   5 minutes
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │         │
 Success   Failure /
    │       Timeout

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker >= 24
- Docker Compose >= 2.20

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Coupon-Processing-System
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set at minimum:

```env
DB_DATABASE=coupon_system
DB_USERNAME=laravel
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

### 2. Start all services

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This starts: **nginx**, **app** (PHP-FPM), **horizon**, **scheduler**, **mysql**, **redis**.

### 3. Run migrations and seed sample coupons

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate
docker compose exec app php artisan db:seed --class=CouponSeeder
```

### 4. Access the application

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| App | http://localhost:8000 |
| Horizon dashboard | http://localhost:8000/horizon |

---

## API Reference

All endpoints require authentication (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).

### Apply a coupon

```
POST /api/coupons/apply
```

**Request body**

```json
{
  "coupon_code": "SUMMER20",
  "cart_id": "cart_abc123",
  "cart_value": 120.00,
  "item_categories": ["clothing"],
  "product_ids": [101, 202],
  "user_segments": ["premium"]
}
```

**Response** `202 Accepted`

```json
{
  "data": {
    "request_id": "a3f9e2...",
    "status": "processing",
    "message": "Coupon verification in progress"
  }
}
```

---

### Poll for validation result

```
GET /api/coupons/status/{requestId}
```

**Response** `200 OK` — possible status values:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `processing` | Job is still running |
| `reserved` | Coupon valid and reserved for 5 minutes |
| `failed` | Validation failed — see `message` for reason |
| `consumed` | Coupon permanently applied to an order |
| `released` | Reservation was freed |
| `error` | System error — safe to retry |

**Example — reserved**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "status": "reserved",
    "message": "Coupon reserved successfully",
    "coupon_code": "SUMMER20",
    "discount_amount": 24.00,
    "setting_version": 3,
    "expires_in_seconds": 300
  }
}
```

---

### Consume a coupon (checkout success)

```
POST /api/coupons/consume
```

```json
{
  "coupon_code": "SUMMER20",
  "cart_id": "cart_abc123",
  "cart_value": 120.00,
  "order_id": "order_xyz789",
  "discount_amount": 24.00,
  "setting_version": 3,
  "request_id": "a3f9e2..."
}
```

**Response** `202 Accepted`

---

### Release a coupon (checkout failure)

```
POST /api/coupons/release
```

```json
{
  "coupon_code": "SUMMER20",
  "cart_id": "cart_abc123",
  "cart_value": 120.00,
  "request_id": "a3f9e2...",
  "reason": "checkout_failed"
}
```

**Response** `202 Accepted`

---

## Queue & Horizon

Three supervisor pools handle different workloads:

| Queue | Supervisor | Workers (prod) | Timeout | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `high` | supervisor-high | 3 – 15 | 30s | Coupon validation |
| `default` | supervisor-default | 2 – 8 | 30s | Consume, release |
| `low` | supervisor-low | 1 – 5 | 60s | Event tracking, cleanup |

Horizon auto-scales workers based on queue wait time. Alert thresholds: `high` > 5s, `default` > 30s, `low` > 120s.

View the Horizon dashboard at `/horizon` to monitor throughput, failed jobs, and wait times.

---

## Rule Engine

`CouponRuleEngine::validate()` always loads the latest active `CouponSetting` from MySQL — no caching — so rule changes apply to the next job execution without any redeployment.

**Supported rules (stored as JSON in `coupon_settings.rules`)**

| Rule | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `global_usage_limit` | integer | Maximum total redemptions |
| `per_user_limit` | integer | Maximum redemptions per user |
| `min_cart_value` | decimal | Minimum cart total required |
| `first_time_user` | boolean | Only users with no previous orders |
| `categories` | string[] | Cart must contain at least one matching category |
| `product_ids` | integer[] | Cart must contain at least one matching product |
| `time_window` | `{start, end}` | Valid only between these times (HH:MM, UTC) |
| `user_segments` | string[] | User must belong to at least one segment |

**Example `coupon_settings.rules`**

```json
{
  "first_time_user": true,
  "categories": ["electronics", "gadgets"],
  "time_window": { "start": "10:00", "end": "14:00" },
  "user_segments": ["vip", "premium"]
}
```

To add a new rule: add a `check*` method in `CouponRuleEngine` and call it from `checkCartRules()`. No other changes required.

---

## Reservation Strategy

Reservations use a **Lua script executed atomically inside Redis**, preventing race conditions across multiple app servers.

**Redis key layout**

| Key | Type | TTL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coupon:res:{code}:{user_id}` | String | 5 min | Reservation payload (idempotency guard) |
| `coupon:res_set:{code}` | Sorted Set | 5 min + 60s | Active reservation set, scored by expiry timestamp |
| `coupon:status:{idempotency_key}` | String | 10 min | Async job result for client polling |

**Reservation Lua script logic**

1. If the reservation key already exists → refresh TTL and return success (idempotent)
2. Prune expired entries from the sorted set (`ZREMRANGEBYSCORE`)
3. Compute `total = mysql_committed_count + redis_active_count`
4. If `total >= global_limit` → return failure
5. Commit: `SET` reservation key with 5-min TTL + `ZADD` to sorted set

MySQL remains the source of truth for committed usage counts. Redis only tracks in-flight reservations.

---

## Event Tracking

Every coupon lifecycle transition is recorded in `coupon_events` via `TrackCouponEventJob` (low queue).

**Event types**

| Event | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `applied` | User submits a coupon |
| `validation_passed` | Rule engine passes |
| `validation_failed` | Rule engine rejects, or reservation slot full |
| `reserved` | Redis reservation committed |
| `consumed` | MySQL usage record written |
| `released` | Reservation freed (failure or cancellation) |
| `expired` | Reservation TTL elapsed (pruned by scheduler) |

Each event stores a full `payload` snapshot:

```json
{
  "cart_context": {
    "cart_id": "cart_abc123",
    "user_id": 42,
    "cart_value": 120.00,
    "item_categories": ["clothing"],
    "is_first_order": false
  },
  "discount_amount": 24.00,
  "rule_snapshot": {
    "version": 3,
    "global_usage_limit": 500,
    "per_user_limit": 1,
    "min_cart_value": 30.00,
    "rules": {},
    "activated_at": "2026-04-18T00:00:00+00:00"
  }
}
```

The `rule_version` column is indexed for analytics queries like "how many coupons were consumed under rule version 3?"

---

## Failure & Recovery

### Job retries

| Job | Tries | Backoff |
|---|---|---|
| `ValidateCouponJob` | 3 | 5s |
| `ConsumeCouponJob` | 5 | 10s |
| `ReleaseCouponJob` | 5 | 5s |
| `TrackCouponEventJob` | 3 | 10s |

All jobs implement `failed()` hooks — failed jobs update the Redis status key so the client is never left polling indefinitely.

### Idempotency

- `ValidateCouponJob` implements `ShouldBeUnique` — duplicate jobs for the same `idempotency_key` are discarded by Horizon.
- `ConsumeCouponJob` checks for an existing `coupon_usages` row before writing — safe to retry any number of times.
- The Redis Lua script uses SETNX semantics — re-reserving the same `{code}:{user_id}` pair simply refreshes the TTL.

### Stuck reservation cleanup

`ReleaseExpiredReservationsJob` runs every 10 minutes (via `php artisan schedule:work` in the `scheduler` container). It calls `ZREMRANGEBYSCORE` on every active coupon's reservation sorted set, pruning entries whose expiry score has passed. This keeps `activeCount()` accurate even when reservation keys expire without an explicit release.
